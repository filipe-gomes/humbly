# humbly

Humbly is a request management web application developed using the Django Web framework for Python and React JS.

Humbly accounts can be one of two roles: Requester or Approver.  
Requesters can create requests and view request they've made.  
Approvers can create requests, approve or deny requests, and view all pending requests and requests they've approved or denied.
